# Medical Image Processing Project

In this project, the student is asked to load, visualize and perform a coregistration of DICOM images. All code save the utils.py is found in the assignment.ipynb file. The following objectives are proposed:

1) DICOM loading and visualization. The data assigned is found in the HCC_002 folder. The animation with rotating Maximum Intensity Projection is found in the results/MIP folder

2) 3D Rigid Coregistration. The data is found in the Project folder and contals an atlas file 'AAL3_1mm', reference image, 'icbm avg 152 t1 tal nlin symmetric VI' and input image, 'RM Brain 3D-SPGR'. Coregistration is performed and Thalamus region is viewed.
