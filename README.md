# medical_imaging

In this project, the student is asked to load, visualize and perform a coregistration of DICOM images. The following objectives are proposed:
1) DICOM loading and visualization
d) The animation with rotating Maximum Intensity Projection is found in the results/MIP folder

2) 3D Rigid Coregistration
a) Coregister the given images using either landmarks (that you should define) or a function
similarity measure (that you should implement). Implement the image coregistration yourself (i.e. without libraries such as PyElastix).
– Reference image: icbm avg 152 t1 tal nlin symmetric VI, of a T1 RM phantom in
a normalized space.
– Input image: RM Brain 3D-SPGR, of an anonimized patient.
b) Visualize the Thalamus region on the input image space.
